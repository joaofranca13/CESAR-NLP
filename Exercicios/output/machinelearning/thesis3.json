{"title": "Social machines: a unified paradigm to describe, design and implement emerging social systems", "abstract": "The open, distributed approach of the Web and the relationship\u2019s prevalence of\r\napplications and services are transforming both the way we develop software\r\nand how they operate and interact with each other. As a result, a novel breed of\r\napplications is emerging, and consequently new mental models are needed to\r\ndeal with them. In this context, Social Machines appear as a promising model\r\nfor developing software. However, it is a fresh topic, with concepts and\r\ndefinitions coming from different research fields, making a unified\r\nunderstanding of the concept a somewhat challenging endeavor. In this thesis\r\nwe provide a more coherent conceptual basis for understanding Social Machines\r\nas a unified paradigm to describe, design and implement emerging social\r\napplications and services. To do that, we revisited the concept of relationship\r\nand extend the notion of Social Machines to establish a common abstraction\r\nmodel that is used for blending computational and social elements into\r\nsoftware. Second, to describe social machines, this proposal presents an analysis\r\nguideline that addresses some issues related to the engineering exercise of\r\nexisting systems. Third, we provide the Social Machine-oriented\r\nArchitecture (SoMAr) - a hybrid style to design social machines through the\r\ncombination of different principles from current software engineering practice.\r\nFinally, we discuss the experiences and lessons learned from applying the social\r\nmachines paradigm in different contexts."}
